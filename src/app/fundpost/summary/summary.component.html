    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Madagascar is facing one of the world's first climate-caused famines. More
      than one million people need help right now. The famine follows four years
      of intense droughts, with conditions worsened as a result of the COVID-19
      pandemic.
    </p>
    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>
      Hundreds of thousands of people in Southern Madagascar, including infants and children, are malnourished and at risk of death by starvation. Food is extremely scarce as a result of droughts and COVID-19 hardships. Some people have resorted to eating locusts and mud.
    </p>
    <h4>Solution</h4>
    <p>
      All donations to this fund will support famine relief efforts in Madagascar. Initially, funding will help meet immediate needs for food, water, and hygiene products. The fund will also support long-term recovery efforts run primarily by local, vetted organizations in Madagascar.
    </p>
